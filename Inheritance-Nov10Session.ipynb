    "## 1. What is Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a feature of **Object-Oriented Programming** that allows a class (called the child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (called the parent or superclass).  \n",
    "It promotes **code reuse**, logical hierarchy, and reduces redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When one class inherits another:\n",
    "- It gains access to the parent class’s methods and variables.\n",
    "- It can override or extend functionality if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why Use Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s why inheritance is useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoids Code Duplication**: Common functionality is written once in a base class and reused across subclasses.\n",
    "- **Enables Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code.\n",
    "- **Establishes Relationships**: Reflects real-world hierarchical relationships (e.g., Animal → Dog, Cat).\n",
    "- **Improves Maintainability**: Common changes can be made in the base class without touching all derived classes.\n"

    "\n",
    "Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance (such as single, multiple, multilevel, or hierarchical) in a single program. It reflects complex real-world relationships where a class may have multiple sources and pass through several inheritance levels. Python supports hybrid inheritance and resolves ambiguity through the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",

    "Use Hybrid Inheritance when:\n",
    "- You need to model a complex class hierarchy combining behaviors from different paths\n",
    "- The system involves multiple dimensions of classification (e.g., type of vehicle + usage purpose)\n",
    "- You want to demonstrate how Python handles MRO conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Vehicle + Car → CityRide / OffRide → Suv\n",
